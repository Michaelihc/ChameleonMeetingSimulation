# 🦎 Chameleon Meeting Simulation (Generated by Claude)

An interactive web-based simulation that demonstrates the famous chameleon color-changing problem from combinatorial mathematics. There are 10 red, 11 blue, 12 green chameleons. Sometimes, two chameleons meet. If they are the same colors, nothing happens. If they are different colors, they will both change to the third color. Can all chameleons ever be the same color?

**Initial Setup:**
- 🔴 10 Red chameleons
- 🔵 11 Blue chameleons  
- 🟢 12 Green chameleons

## ✨ Features

### Interactive Controls
- **Manual Selection**: Click on two chameleons to make them meet
- **Random Meetings**: Generate random encounters between chameleons
- **Auto Mode**: Continuous automatic meetings with adjustable speed
- **Reset Function**: Return to initial state at any time

### Visual Elements
- **Live Grid Display**: Visual representation of all chameleons
- **Real-time Statistics**: Current count of each color
- **Activity Log**: Timestamped history of all meetings
- **Color-coded Interface**: Easy identification of chameleon colors

### Customization
- **Speed Control**: Adjust auto-mode timing (100ms - 2000ms)
- **Interactive Selection**: Visual feedback for selected chameleons
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## 🔬 How It Works

### Meeting Rules
1. **Same Color**: If two chameleons of the same color meet → **No change**
2. **Different Colors**: If two chameleons of different colors meet → **Both change to the third color**

### Color Transformation Logic
- 🔴 Red + 🔵 Blue → 🟢🟢 Both become Green
- 🔴 Red + 🟢 Green → 🔵🔵 Both become Blue  
- 🔵 Blue + 🟢 Green → 🔴🔴 Both become Red

## 🧮 Mathematical Background

This simulation demonstrates an important mathematical invariant:

**Key Property**: The difference between any two color counts remains constant throughout the simulation.

**Initial differences:**
- |Red - Blue| = |10 - 11| = 1
- |Red - Green| = |10 - 12| = 2  
- |Blue - Green| = |11 - 12| = 1

These differences will **never change**, regardless of how many meetings occur!

**Mathematical Proof**: Each meeting either:
- Changes nothing (same colors)
- Increases one color by 2 and decreases the other two by 1 each

This preserves all pairwise differences modulo 3.

### Tips
- Watch how the color differences remain constant
- Try to predict if it's possible to make all chameleons the same color
- Experiment with different meeting strategies

## 🎨 Customization

### Changing Initial Numbers
Modify the `initializeChameleons()` method in the JavaScript section:

```javascript
// Change these numbers (keep in mind the mathematical constraints)
for (let i = 0; i < 15; i++) {          // 15 red instead of 10
    this.chameleons.push({ id: i, color: 'red' });
}
```

### Styling
Customize colors and appearance by modifying the CSS variables:

```css
.red { color: #your-red-color; }
.blue { color: #your-blue-color; }
.green { color: #your-green-color; }
```
