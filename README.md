# ChameleonMeetingSimulation
Chameleon Meeting Simulation for this problem on invariants: There are 10 red, 11 blue, 12 green chameleons. Sometimes, two chameleons meet. If they are the same colors, nothing happens. If they are different colors, they will both change to the third color. Can all chameleons ever be the same color?
